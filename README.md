# Phase-1-Project
My Phase-1 project is a simple Black Jack game.  It entails simple $5 dollar hands, where the user can only "Hit" or "Stay"(aka No splitting, Doubling down, insurance, etc.). 

# Object of the game 
Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

# Card Values/Scoring
It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its numbered value.

# Tips 
1 - At any point (Once the cards are dealt) you may mouse over the "User's Hand" text in red, to see the current value of your hand. 
2 - If dealer is showing a 6 or less on their first card, its best to stay and try to make them bust. 

# Game Play 
Step 1: User should start by clicking the "Deal" button to deal out the intial cards. 

Step 2: User has the option to either "Hit" or "Stay"

  Step2a: If user selects to "Hit", one more card will be added to his hand/total, if the Players's total is over 21 the Player busts and lose's. If the Player has not busted then they have the option to either hit again or stay (repeat)

  Step2b: If user selects "Stay", then the Dealer will flip his second card, revealing his intial score. If the Dealers score is greater than or equal to 17 that is his final score and Player/Dealer compare hands to see who has higher score and is the Winner. If the Dealers initial score is less than 16, then they must "Hit", until their score has either surpassed 16 or busted. 
  
Step 3: Once the hand is over an alert message will pop up, informing the Player whether they won or lost. At the same time, the balance box in the lower left corner will update in increments of $5 and show a green box if the Player has a positive balance or a red box if the Player has a negative balance.

Step 4: Once the Player closes the alert box notification, they can click "Reset Hand's" which will re-shuffle the cards.  

Step 5: Player can then hit the "Deal" button to play again and deal out the intial cards to both the Player/Dealer

Step 6: Repeat
